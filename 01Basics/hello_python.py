#Best way to install python is using python.org 
#python ko run kahi bhi karae vo sara ka sara kam aik hi commmunity karti hai 
#behavior of language does not changes, in JS behavior changes depending upon where you are running it node or browser
#download the setup according to the operting system 
#Installs straight forwardly
#In windows you only have python, however in mac you write python3 to run the code.
print("hello")

# def stands for definition
def chai(n):  #when we press enter it gets indentated automatically
    print(n)

chai(10) #can give integer or string any datatype
# we can execute the chai function using .notation and file name hello.python in python shell 


# decalare various ariable 
chai_one="lemon tea"
chai_two="ginder tea"
chai_three="adrak chai"
# now if we try to use these variable using the .notation it shows no attribute named as chai_one ,because when we imported it then it was not there. 
#  so in shell we need to close the shell and reimport it , or rather now we need to reload it on the go. 
# from importlib import reload   #this reloads the changes done ont he file.
# write reload(hello_chai) now we can use the attribites using the dot notation.
